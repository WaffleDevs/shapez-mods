how to make a mod (use example mod) for achievement lib (the complicated way)

install and setup https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-shapezio-mod (guide there)

copy the contents of the [example mod](https://github.com/WaffleDevs/shapez-mods/blob/main/achievement-lib-cli-example-mod.js) into src/{mod}/js/main.js

run yarn dev in the root of your shapez mods

put achievement lib into the root/mods/ folder

Boom.
